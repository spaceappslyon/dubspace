#SunBell

With the will of vulgarize science and the desire of help universe exploration, our project takes place between art and science. Using the sound emitted by the sun we have created a music and a "responding to the song" visualisation that brings the spectators inside the star, in order to make him feel this latest and be puzzled by it. Besides, using only the fundamental frequency of the sun sing, the visualisation is very clear and can lead to compare it with other stars.
